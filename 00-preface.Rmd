# (PART) PREFACE {-}

# Welcome to the LMS Integration Q&A Guide {-}

Welcome to the **LMS Integration Q&A Guide**, part of the open learning system at **Complex Data Insights (CDI)**.

This guide is for **educators, mentors, teaching assistants, and instructional designers** who want to integrate CDI’s question-driven data science resources into learning platforms like **Moodle**, **Canvas**, or **Google Classroom**.

Whether you're new to LMS tools or an experienced course creator, this guide will help you use CDI content to design high-impact, skill-focused learning experiences.

## 🎯 Why This Guide Exists {-}

CDI Q&A guides are built around **real questions, real code, and real-world practice** — using both Python and R. They are modular, layered (EDA → VIZ → STATS → ML), and ideal for flexible teaching.

This LMS guide shows you how to:

- ✅ Convert Q&A content into weekly modules or themed lessons  
- 🔗 Embed GitHub-hosted notebooks or pages inside your LMS  
- 📝 Create assignments, quizzes, and submission portals  
- 💬 Use forums and interactivity to deepen engagement  
- 📈 Track student growth and adjust learning paths

## 👥 Who This Is For {-}

This resource is helpful for:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Instructors** looking to offer open and reproducible coding lessons  
- 📚 **Mentors and program coordinators** supporting hybrid or remote learners  
- 🧩 **Instructional designers** working across disciplines  
- 🌍 **Educators in NGOs or academic institutions** launching data-driven programs

We welcome both **LMS beginners** and **advanced users**. The guide is layered with clarity for new users, plus tips and scaffolding that experienced users can adapt.

## 🗂️ What’s Inside {-}

The guide is organized as practical Q&A entries, each answering a focused question and providing:

- Clear walkthroughs with examples  
- Tips for structure, navigation, and engagement  
- Open-use templates and remixable suggestions

Topics include:

1. Getting started with LMS platforms  
2. Uploading CDI materials  
3. Designing assignments and feedback  
4. Linking external tools and repositories  
5. Structuring your course for launch  
6. Supporting learners and refining your course  

> 📌 **Pro Tip:** CDI guides are best embedded as **live web links** using GitHub Pages. This ensures your learners always access the latest version and can copy/paste working code.

You're encouraged to:
- Customize content for your local LMS or institution
