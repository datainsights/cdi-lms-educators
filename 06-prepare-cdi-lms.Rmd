# How do you prepare your CDI course for launch on any LMS?

## Explanation

Creating a MoodleCloud course based on the CDI framework is a powerful way to share data science and bioinformatics knowledge. Whether you're using the Q&A structure as-is or adapting it for a new audience, your goal is to deliver a meaningful, skills-focused learning experience. MoodleCloud supports flexible, interactive design — but success starts with good planning.

Here’s a step-by-step approach you can follow:

### 1. Clarify Your Course Goals  
What will learners *actually be able to do* after completing your course? Focus on outcomes that are:

- **Specific** (e.g., “create a volcano plot in R”)
- **Measurable** (e.g., “interpret PCA results from RNA-Seq data”)
- **Relevant** (e.g., “apply logistic regression to a bioinformatics dataset”)

These goals will shape your content, assessments, and learning flow.

### 2. Know Your Audience  
Identify who you're designing for:

- Beginner learners? Subject-matter peers? High school educators?
- Are they tech-savvy or just getting started?
- Will they access content on phones or computers?

Tailor your delivery style and content type to match their expectations and learning context.

### 3. Select the Right Delivery Format  
Decide on your teaching structure:

- Will the course be **self-paced**, **scheduled**, or **blended**?
- Will you use a **layered design** (EDA → VIZ → STATS → ML)?
- Will each module follow a **weekly plan** or **domain-focused unit**?

The CDI modular Q&A format is perfect for flexible design — each entry can become a standalone learning block.

### 4. Build or Adapt Content for Impact  
Use a combination of:

- Existing CDI Q&A entries (Markdown-based and reproducible)  
- Videos, diagrams, and datasets to illustrate concepts  
- Moodle-compatible resources (PDFs, quizzes, links)

Write with clarity, keep examples practical, and use visuals where possible. Remember, real-world relevance builds engagement.

### 5. Integrate Assessments Thoughtfully  
Assess learning with:
- **Auto-graded quizzes** for quick feedback  
- **Open-ended assignments** for coding practice  
- **Discussion prompts** to encourage reflection

Tie each assessment directly to a learning outcome and let learners know what success looks like.

### 6. Add Meaningful Interactivity  
Don’t make the course a one-way experience. Use MoodleCloud tools to:

- Host **peer discussion forums** (e.g., “What challenges did you face in building your ggplot?”)  
- Set up **collaborative wikis** or glossaries (e.g., define terms like TPM, OTU)  
- Use **H5P** or Moodle quizzes for interactive check-ins

Interaction fosters deeper learning and helps you build a learning community.

### 7. Test Before Launch  
Run a small pilot:

- Invite a few learners to try the course  
- Gather feedback (usability, clarity, engagement)  
- Refine your structure and resources accordingly

Even a short test run can dramatically improve your course quality and learner experience.

## ✅ Takeaway

Launching a CDI-based course on MoodleCloud is about combining **clear goals**, **modular content**, and **interactive design**. The Q&A structure provides a flexible scaffold — and Moodle tools let you bring it to life for your learners.
