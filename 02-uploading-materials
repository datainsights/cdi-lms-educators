# How do you embed a Google Colab notebook for student use?

## Explanation

If you’re using Python-based exercises from a CDI guide, you can convert code snippets into a Google Colab notebook and embed the link:

1. Copy or adapt a notebook (e.g., `eda-qna.ipynb`)
2. Upload it to your Google Drive
3. Open it in **Google Colab** and click **Share → Anyone with the link**
4. Copy the Colab link
5. In your LMS, use **Add Web Link** or **Post Announcement**
6. Include brief instructions (e.g., "Open in Colab and run cells to complete the Q&A")

Colab provides an easy way for students to code without installing anything.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Google Colab is a no-setup coding platform ideal for LMS integration with Python Q&A.
