# (PART) UPLOADING TO LMS {-}

# Uploading and Embedding CDI Materials {-}

This section shows how to bring Complex Data Insights (CDI) content into your LMS — not as static files, but as **live, up-to-date learning resources**. We recommend embedding **GitHub Pages links** to deliver the most current version of each guide.

# How do you add a GitHub Pages link to an LMS module?

## Explanation

Each CDI guide is published as a searchable, mobile-friendly site (via GitHub Pages). For example:

https://general-ds.complexdatainsights.com
https://microbiome.complexdatainsights.com


To link it in your LMS:

1. **Copy** the URL from your browser  
2. In your LMS, choose **Add External Link** or **Embed URL**  
3. Add a title like: *"Explore the General DS Q&A Guide Online"*  
4. Paste the link, save, and preview  

Some LMS platforms allow the site to be embedded directly using an iframe.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Linking to GitHub Pages ensures learners access the most current version — with no upload required.

# What if learners want a PDF version?

## Explanation

We intentionally avoid uploading static PDFs into LMS platforms. Instead, let learners generate one if they wish:

1. Open the live guide  
2. Press **Ctrl+P** (Windows) or **Cmd+P** (Mac)  
3. Choose **“Save as PDF”** in their browser  

This saves a clean, printable version — without losing the benefits of always-updated online content.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Live web delivery is preferred. PDFs can still be created individually by students on demand.

# How do you embed a Google Colab notebook for student use?

## Explanation

If you’ve converted a Q&A exercise into a Colab notebook, you can easily share it:

1. Upload the `.ipynb` notebook to Google Drive  
2. Open it in **Google Colab**  
3. Click **Share → Anyone with the link**  
4. Copy the URL  
5. In your LMS, choose **Add Link** or **Post Announcement**  
6. Add instructions like: *“Open in Colab and run cells to complete the Q&A.”*

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Google Colab offers a zero-install solution for Python exercises.

# How do you embed a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in LMS platforms?

## Explanation

LMS platforms don’t natively open `.ipynb` files, but there are workarounds:

| Option           | What to Do                                                                 |
|;------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NBViewer**      | Upload notebook to GitHub → share via [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org) |
| **Google Colab**  | Share as an editable or read-only notebook link                           |
| **Binder**        | Launch `.ipynb` interactively via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)    |
| **HTML Export**   | Convert `.ipynb` to `.html` using: `jupyter nbconvert your_notebook.ipynb --to html` |

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Convert or link notebooks through Colab, NBViewer, or HTML for smoother LMS use.

# How do you upload assignment templates with placeholders?

## Explanation

To guide students through solving a Q&A, provide a structured assignment template with blank sections.

You can distribute this template using:

- Google Docs (with editing access)
- The LMS assignment text field
- GitHub Classroom or a shared Drive folder

This allows learners to work through the question without seeing the full answer.

### Example Template:


## Question

How do you summarize a numeric variable using Python?

```

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Templates help students practice structured thinking without giving away the full solution.
