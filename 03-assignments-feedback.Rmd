This section helps educators design effective student activities from CDI Q&A content. You’ll learn how to turn walkthroughs into assignments, accept student submissions, and give feedback using LMS tools.

# How do you turn a Q&A prompt into a student assignment?

## Explanation

Every Q&A in a CDI guide includes:

- A **real-world question**  
- A **walkthrough explanation**  
- **Python and R code**  

To convert this into an LMS assignment:

1. **Copy the question only** (hide explanation and solution)
2. Add instructions like:
   - “Answer the question using Python or R”
   - “Submit a Google Colab link, Jupyter Notebook, or code file”
3. Optionally include a **starter template** with headers for:
   - Explanation  
   - Code  
   - Output or screenshot  

In Moodle or Canvas:
- Use “Add Assignment” → paste question → set due date and grading method

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Strip out the explanation and code from Q&A entries to create authentic student tasks.

# What formats can students use to submit answers?

## Explanation

CDI assignments are flexible and platform-agnostic. Students can submit:

| Submission Format       | Description                              |
|:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| **Notebook (.ipynb)**   | For Colab or Jupyter-based assignments   |
| **Code file (.py / .R)**| For script-based tasks                   |
| **Google Doc link**     | For written explanations and embedded code |
| **Screenshot or output**| For visual results (e.g., plots, summaries) |
| **PDF or Word file**    | *(Optional)* for full writeups — not required |

Always remind students to test and comment their code before submission.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Offer flexible formats, but emphasize reproducibility and clarity over document style.

# How do you review and grade coding assignments in LMS?

## Explanation

Most LMS platforms support built-in grading workflows:

1. Open the student’s submission
2. Check:
   - **Explanation quality**
   - **Code logic and correctness**
   - **Output presence and clarity (e.g., tables, plots)**

You can use **rubrics** to ensure fairness and consistency:

- 10 pts: Explanation
- 10 pts: Code implementation
- 10 pts: Output/visuals

Feedback options:

- **Inline comments** (e.g., Moodle Annotate, Canvas SpeedGrader)  
- **Custom rubric scoring**  
- **Download and mark externally**, then re-upload scores or annotated files

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Use rubrics and focused comments to create learning moments, not just grades.

# How do you encourage peer review or discussion on Q&A topics?

## Explanation

LMS forums are great for reinforcing open-ended problem-solving.

You can:

1. Post a Q&A prompt (without solution) as a **discussion topic**
2. Ask students to:
   - Share a proposed solution  
   - Comment constructively on a peer’s response  
   - Suggest alternate approaches or critique logic

Follow up by summarizing patterns or highlighting standout thinking.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Peer feedback turns Q&A learning into collaborative exploration.

# How do you scaffold feedback so learners reflect and revise?

## Explanation

Beyond grading, help learners **reflect on their process**. Add simple prompts such as:

- “What part of this Q&A was most challenging for you?”
- “How did you debug your code?”
- “Compare your submission with the model solution — what’s one thing you learned?”

You can include these as:
- Short response fields in LMS submissions  
- End-of-assignment reflection prompts  
- Follow-up discussion board threads

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Reflection deepens learning and builds self-assessment skills.
