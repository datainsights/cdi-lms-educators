# Assignments, Submissions & Feedback {-}

This section helps educators design learner-centered activities using CDI’s Q&A structure. You’ll learn how to turn real questions into assignments, collect submissions in flexible formats, and give meaningful feedback using your LMS.

# How do you convert a CDI Q&A into a student assignment?

## Explanation

Each CDI Q&A includes:

- ✅ A **real-world question**  
- 📘 A step-by-step **explanation**  
- 💻 Sample **Python and R code**

To turn this into an LMS-based assignment:

1. **Use only the question** — hide the explanation and code walkthrough  
2. Provide instructions like:  
   - “Answer this using Python or R”  
   - “Submit a notebook link, code file, or written explanation”  
3. (Optional) Add a **starter template** with placeholders for:  
   - ✍️ Explanation  
   - 💻 Code  
   - 📸 Output or screenshot

### LMS Setup Tip:
In most platforms (e.g., Moodle, Canvas, Google Classroom):
- Use **“Add Assignment”** or equivalent  
- Paste the question as your prompt  
- Choose submission types (e.g., file upload, text entry)  
- Set deadlines and grading criteria

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Focus on the core question, let learners explore, and use LMS tools to structure it as a real task.

# What formats can students use to submit answers?

## Explanation

Submission formats should support clarity, reproducibility, and platform flexibility. Common options include:

| Format                  | Description                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Notebook (.ipynb)**   | Ideal for Colab or Jupyter work              |
| **Script (.py / .R)**   | Simple code file for quick review            |
| **Google Doc or link**  | Useful for mixed code + explanation writeups |
| **Screenshot or output**| For showing final result or plot             |
| **PDF/Word file**       | *(Optional)* for full reports                |

Encourage students to:
- Add comments and brief notes  
- Use consistent naming and formatting  
- Make sure code runs before submission

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Be flexible on format, but clear on quality expectations and code readability.

# How do you review and grade coding assignments in your LMS?

## Explanation

Most LMS platforms (including Moodle, Canvas, and others) support:

- File uploads or online text  
- Rubric-based or manual grading  
- Inline comments or downloadable annotations  
- Private feedback fields  

You can also:
- Share **model answers** post-deadline using full CDI walkthroughs  
- Encourage **resubmissions** based on feedback  
- Use **discussion boards or peer review** for collaborative learning

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Use your LMS’s grading and feedback tools to promote iterative improvement — not just binary scores.
