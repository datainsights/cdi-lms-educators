This section helps educators design effective student activities from CDI Q&A content. You’ll learn how to turn walkthroughs into assignments, accept student submissions, and give feedback using LMS tools.

# How do you turn a Q&A prompt into a student assignment?

## Explanation

Every Q&A in a CDI guide includes:

- A **real-world question**
- A **walkthrough explanation**
- **Python and R code**

To convert this into an LMS assignment:

1. **Copy the question only** (hide solution)
2. Add instructions like:
   - “Answer the question using Python or R”
   - “Submit a Colab/Jupyter link or upload your notebook”
3. Optionally include a **starter template** with headers for:
   - Explanation  
   - Code  
   - Output or screenshot  

In Moodle or Canvas:
- Use “Add Assignment” → paste content → set due date and grading method

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Strip out the explanation/code from Q&A entries to create authentic student tasks.

# What formats can students use to submit answers?

## Explanation

You can accept student responses in various formats depending on the LMS:

| Submission Format | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Notebook (.ipynb)**  | For Colab or Jupyter-based work       |
| **PDF or Word file**   | For written explanation + code copy  |
| **Google Doc link**    | Editable online submission           |
| **Code file (.py / .R)** | If the assignment is script-based    |
| **Screenshot or output** | For plot-based or visual responses   |

Always remind students to test their notebooks before submission.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Offer flexible formats (notebooks, scripts, PDFs) to match your learners’ comfort level.

# How do you review and grade coding assignments in LMS?

## Explanation

Many LMS platforms offer built-in grading workflows:

1. Open the submitted file or notebook
2. Check:
   - **Explanation quality**
   - **Code correctness and logic**
   - **Output presence (plots/tables)**
3. Use **rubrics** if available:
   - 10 pts: Explanation
   - 10 pts: Correct code
   - 10 pts: Output clarity

You can use:

- **Inline comments** in LMS (e.g., Canvas SpeedGrader)
- **Rubric scoring**
- Or download submissions for batch review

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Use simple rubrics and comment-based feedback to help students learn from each submission.

# How do you encourage peer review or discussion on Q&A topics?

## Explanation

Many LMS platforms support forums or discussion boards. To foster peer learning:

1. Post a Q&A (without answer) as a **discussion prompt**
2. Ask students to:
   - Propose a solution  
   - Comment on each other’s code or logic  
   - Share different ways to solve the same problem  

Instructors can summarize or highlight great answers afterward.

This promotes collaborative thinking and deepens understanding.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Turn Q&A prompts into class discussions to build critical thinking and code-sharing skills.

# How do you scaffold feedback so learners reflect and revise?

## Explanation

To support growth, include structured prompts like:

- “What part of this question was most challenging?”
- “How would you explain this to a peer?”
- “Compare your answer to the solution in the guide — what would you change?”

These can be added:
- At the end of each assignment
- In a post-submission form or reflection document

Reflection encourages metacognition and self-directed learning.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Use simple follow-up prompts to turn code submission into a reflective learning cycle.
