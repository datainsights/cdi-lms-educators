# How can institutions structure full courses around CDI Q&A guides?

## Explanation

Each CDI guide is already structured as a **modular Q&A series** with real-world scope. To turn a guide into a formal course:

1. Choose a domain (e.g., General Data Science, Microbiome, Career Skills)
2. Use the four core CDI layers:  
   - **EDA → VIZ → STATS → ML**
3. Assign each Q&A as:
   - Reading content  
   - Lab exercise  
   - Homework or discussion  
4. Combine with institution-specific lectures or videos

CDI modules can serve as core content or supplementary labs.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI guides can form the backbone of practical courses or blended learning pathways.

# How can teams coordinate content use across instructors?

## Explanation

To manage multi-instructor delivery:

- Create a **shared LMS course shell** or **Google Drive folder**  
- Assign Q&A batches to instructors for review or adaptation  
- Use a common naming system (e.g., `Q1.3 – Boxplots`, `Q2.2 – PCA`)  
- Maintain version control by linking to GitHub source repos  
- Hold short meetings to align on pace and goals

Shared documentation ensures consistency across classrooms or cohorts.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: A coordinated setup using versioned Q&A entries makes team-teaching smoother and more scalable.

# What licensing rules apply to institutional LMS use?

## Explanation

All free CDI content (e.g., public EDA layers) is released under the **MIT License**, allowing free use with attribution.

However, the following require a **custom license**:
- Redistribution of premium content (VIZ, STATS, ML layers)
- Institution-wide LMS deployments
- Branded or white-labeled adaptations

You can request a tailored license at:

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Free layers are open; premium use across institutions requires extended licensing.

# How can institutions track learning outcomes using CDI guides?

## Explanation

Since each Q&A is a self-contained learning unit, they can be aligned with:

- **Course-level outcomes** (e.g., “Apply statistical models to biological data”)
- **Rubrics or Bloom’s taxonomy levels** (e.g., Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- **Competency-based modules**

LMS tools can be used to:
- Measure submission rates
- Grade with rubrics
- Assess reflection and improvement over time

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI Q&As support outcome-based education when linked to LMS metrics and rubrics.

# Can CDI guides support flipped or blended classrooms?

## Explanation

Yes — the Q&A format is perfect for flipped or hybrid teaching:

| In-Class                    | Out-of-Class                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Discuss Q&A challenges     | Students study walk-throughs     |
| Compare peer answers       | Watch instructor videos          |
| Code reviews or live demos | Submit code from Q&A prompts     |

You can assign reading + code from the guide before class, and use class time for discussion, exploration, or group problem solving.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI’s structure aligns naturally with flipped classroom models that center student engagement.
