# How can institutions structure full courses around CDI Q&A guides?

## Explanation

Each CDI guide is already structured as a **modular Q&A series** grounded in real-world skills. To turn a guide into a formal course:

1. Choose a domain (e.g., General Data Science, Microbiome, Career Skills)  
2. Use the four core CDI learning layers:  
   - **EDA → VIZ → STATS → ML**  
3. Assign each Q&A as:  
   - Reading content (via GitHub Pages link)  
   - Coding lab or problem-solving session  
   - Homework or guided discussion  
4. Supplement with institution-specific lectures, videos, or grading systems

CDI modules can serve as core teaching content or as enrichment for existing syllabi.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI guides can serve as a foundation for hands-on data courses or flexible blended-learning models.

# How can teams coordinate content use across instructors?

## Explanation

Multi-instructor programs benefit from shared resources and planning. You can:

- Create a **shared LMS course shell** or **collaborative Drive folder**  
- Distribute Q&A responsibilities across instructors or TAs  
- Use a common naming convention (e.g., `Q1.2 – Summary Stats`, `Q2.4 – PCA`)  
- Link to version-controlled guides via GitHub Pages or source repos  
- Hold short sync meetings to align scope, pace, and assessments

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Shared, versioned Q&A content supports scalable team teaching with consistency.

# What licensing rules apply to institutional LMS use?

## Explanation

All **public EDA layers** from CDI are released under the **MIT License**, which allows free use and adaptation — with proper attribution.

However, a **custom license is required** for:

- Redistribution of premium content (VIZ, STATS, ML layers)  
- LMS-wide deployments or site-wide course shells  
- Branding or adapting CDI content for third-party resale or certification programs  

You can request an institutional or commercial license here:

> ✅ **Takeaway**: Free layers are open; extended or branded use requires a license.

# How can institutions track learning outcomes using CDI guides?

## Explanation

Because each Q&A is modular and clearly scoped, it’s easy to map them to:

- **Learning outcomes** (e.g., “Analyze trends using summary statistics”)  
- **Bloom’s taxonomy** levels (e.g., Apply, Analyze, Evaluate)  
- **Program competencies or accreditation metrics**

LMS platforms support:

- Rubric-based grading  
- Assignment completion tracking  
- Student self-reflection prompts  
- Code submission analysis

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI Q&As are compatible with outcome-based teaching and institutional reporting.

# Can CDI guides support flipped or blended classrooms?

## Explanation

Yes — CDI Q&A content is ideal for **flipped** and **hybrid** classrooms:

| In-Class                    | Out-of-Class                        |
|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Live coding demos          | Q&A reading + preview               |
| Peer discussion & feedback | Independent code walkthroughs       |
| Group problem solving      | Self-paced code replication         |

Use the online Q&A guides as pre-class study materials. Then focus class time on extension, collaboration, and synthesis.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI’s format supports active learning, whether in-person, remote, or hybrid.
