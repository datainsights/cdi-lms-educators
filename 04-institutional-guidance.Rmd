# How can institutions structure full courses using CDI Q&A guides?

## Explanation

Each CDI domain is organized as a **modular Q&A sequence**, already scaffolded into four learning layers:

- **EDA** – Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **VIZ** – Visualization  
- **STATS** – Statistical Analysis  
- **ML** – Machine Learning

To build a full course from CDI content:

1. Select a domain (e.g., General Data Science, Microbiome, Career Growth)  
2. Use the four CDI layers as **core modules**  
3. Assign each Q&A as:  
   - Reading or demo (via GitHub Pages)  
   - Coding activity or lab  
   - Homework or peer discussion  
4. Supplement with your own lectures, videos, or grading system

This makes it easy to adapt CDI to both **credit-bearing academic programs** and **non-formal upskilling paths**.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI guides can serve as a complete, modular backbone for hands-on, data-centric courses in diverse institutional settings.

# How can teaching teams collaborate around CDI materials?

## Explanation

Programs with multiple instructors or teaching assistants can coordinate effectively by using shared tools and clear communication.

Ways to collaborate include:

- Creating a shared **LMS shell**, **Drive folder**, or **GitHub repo**  
- Dividing topics or Q&A coverage among instructors  
- Using standardized naming (e.g., `Q2.1 – Missing Data`, `Q3.3 – MA Plot`)  
- Linking to version-controlled CDI content via GitHub Pages  
- Running brief team syncs to align on schedule, assessments, and edits

> ✅ **Takeaway**: The modular, versioned format of CDI guides supports collaborative teaching and scalable delivery across departments or terms.

# What licensing rules apply to institutional use of CDI?

## Explanation

All CDI learning materials — including EDA, VIZ, STATS, and ML layers — are currently published under a **permissive open license** to encourage wide adoption and adaptation.

Specifically:

- ✅ **Content and educational materials** are shared under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license

- Use CDI materials in institutional courses  
- Translate, adapt, and modify the content  
- Embed in your LMS or learning platform  
- Share with students, teams, and collaborators

### Just include attribution:
- Mention **Complex Data Insights (CDI)** as the source  
- Link back to the original guide (e.g., GitHub Pages or repo URL)

> ✅ **Takeaway**: CDI is designed to empower educators. You are welcome — and encouraged — to remix and teach with it freely, as long as attribution is provided.
