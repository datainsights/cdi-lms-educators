"],["how-do-you-define-an-lms-and-its-role-in-teaching-data-science.html", "1 How do you define an LMS and its role in teaching data science? 1.1 Explanation", " 1 How do you define an LMS and its role in teaching data science? 1.1 Explanation A Learning Management System (LMS) is a platform that enables instructors to organize, deliver, and track educational content and student engagement. Examples include Moodle, Google Classroom, Canvas, and Blackboard. When teaching data science or bioinformatics, an LMS helps by: Hosting reading material and tutorials (e.g., PDF Q&amp;A guides) Delivering coding assignments and collecting submissions Tracking student progress and feedback Integrating tools like GitHub, Google Colab, or Jupyter An LMS serves as a central hub for your learners to access CDI Q&amp;A content and interact with it in a structured way. ‚úÖ Takeaway: LMS platforms help bridge open educational resources like CDI with institutional teaching workflows.
