# What’s Next for LMS + CDI Integration?

## Explanation

This guide was created to help you confidently bring **Complex Data Insights (CDI)** materials into your preferred LMS — whether you're using Moodle, Canvas, Google Classroom, or another platform.

Now that your course is designed and ready to launch, you may want to explore:

- 📊 **Tracking learner progress and feedback**
- 🤝 **Using discussion forums for peer support**
- 📅 **Developing weekly schedules using Q&A entries**
- 🌍 **Translating or localizing CDI content for your learners**
- 🔁 **Sharing back your improvements with the CDI community**

Remember — CDI is an open learning ecosystem. Your contributions, translations, and remix ideas are not only welcome — they help others teach better too.

> ✅ **Takeaway**: You’re part of something bigger. Keep improving your course, and don’t hesitate to reach out or give back to this growing open community.

Let’s keep building, together.
