# Getting Started with LMS Platforms {-}

In this section, we explore foundational questions that help educators understand:

- What an LMS is  
- How it supports modern data science and bioinformatics education  
- How CDI Q&A guides can be integrated into platforms like **Moodle**, **Canvas**, or **Google Classroom**

# What is an LMS and how does it support teaching data science?

## Explanation

A **Learning Management System (LMS)** is a platform for delivering, organizing, and tracking educational content and learner progress. Examples include:
- **Moodle**
- **Canvas**
- **Google Classroom**
- **Blackboard**

When teaching **data science**, **bioinformatics**, or **coding**, LMS tools are valuable because they allow you to:

- Embed CDI guides from GitHub Pages or link to interactive notebooks  
- Share files, videos, and reading materials alongside code exercises  
- Assign and collect coding submissions or reflection tasks  
- Track student progress and give timely feedback  
- Host discussions, quizzes, and collaborative activities

> ✅ **Takeaway**: An LMS provides the teaching infrastructure that turns CDI content into a complete learning experience.

# How does CDI content fit inside an LMS?

## Explanation

CDI Q&A guides are designed for **modular integration**, meaning each guide (or even each question) can be used as a **standalone learning unit**.

Here’s how CDI content fits:

- 🧱 **Modular:** Each Q&A becomes a lesson, a task, or a weekly focus  
- 🌐 **Web-ready:** Hosted via GitHub Pages, easy to link or embed  
- 📁 **Downloadable:** Notebooks, CSVs, and PDFs can be uploaded directly  
- 💬 **Discussion-friendly:** Promotes reflection and analysis  
- 💡 **Flexible:** Works with self-paced, instructor-led, or blended models

## ✅ Summary

> LMS platforms give structure and continuity to CDI's open Q&A content.  
> Whether you're using Moodle, Google Classroom, or Canvas, you can adapt these materials into **flexible, learner-centered experiences**.
